<a id="markov-chains" class="anchor" href="#markov-chains" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>markov chains</h1>

<p>This repo is just me messing around with markov chains in Ruby. This code is horrible, though I TDD'd it as sort of a secondary exercise. I probably wont come back and make it nicer, either. Bleh.</p>

<h2>
<a id="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h2>

<ol>
<li><code>require './markov'</code></li>
<li><code>markov = Markov.new</code></li>
<li>
<code>markov.ingest(&lt;all of your sample text&gt;)</code> (this can be called more than once)</li>
<li><code>generated_string = markov.generate(&lt;number of words you want in the string&gt;)</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>how it works</h2>

<p>It works on a really simple model of building a hash containing keys that correspond to individual words in the given training text, then associating that to arrays of successor words, then "randomly" building a new string of a certain size.</p>

<p>I trained it on a bunch of Hacker News and Reddit comments and it seemed to work well with larger data-sets, though with smaller ones there are some issues. I don't handle the "last" word in the training data at all, so you just get a dead reference after that. I might actually fix that, somehow/someday... but for now, it's a pretty neat 3am PoC.</p>

<p>I "cleverly" avoided any need to build this around real statistics by just smashing arrays together and sampling from them. So, for instance, given:</p>

<p><code>this is a test of this system</code>,</p>

<p><code>this</code> has a 50/50 chance of having <code>is</code> or <code>system</code> come after this. The way the model currently works, this is represented as: <code>{"this" =&gt; ["is", "system"]}</code>, which, when sampled, sort of inherently has a 50/50 chance of being one or the other. Three items following? 1/3 chance. 16? 1/16 chance. You get the idea.</p>
